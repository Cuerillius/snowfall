# Snowfall Userscript
Simple Tampermonkey script that lets it snow on all websites!

## Installation
Install the Tampermonkey extension for your browser.
Open snowfall.js in this repository and click Raw to install.

## Acknowledgements
Most of the snowfall code is from here: [codepen.io/bsehovac](https://codepen.io/bsehovac/pen/GPwXxq), I just tweaked some things and made it work as a Tampermonkey extension.
